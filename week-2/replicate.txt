## Procedure to create a replicate set


Step-1 
Start each member of the replica set with the appropriate options.

The following example specifies the replica set name and the ip binding through the --replSet and --bind_ip command-line options:

mongod --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>


Step-2
Connect a mongo shell to one of the mongod instances

mongo

Step-3
Initiate the replica set

rs.initiate( {
   _id : "rs0",
   members: [
      { _id: 0, host: "mongodb0.example.net:27017" },
      { _id: 1, host: "mongodb1.example.net:27017" },
      { _id: 2, host: "mongodb2.example.net:27017" }
   ]
})

Step-4
View the replica set configuration.

rs.conf()

Step-5
Ensure that the replica set has a primary

Use rs.status() to identify the primary in the replica set.
